Then open: `http://localhost:8080`

### **Option 2: Build for Production**
```bash
cd pitchup_app
flutter build web --release
```
The built files will be in `build/web/` directory.

## 🌐 **Deployment Options:**

### **1. Firebase Hosting (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize hosting
firebase init hosting

# Build and deploy
flutter build web --release
firebase deploy
```

2. Push `build/web` contents to `gh-pages` branch
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

## 🔥 **Firebase Production Setup:**

To enable full Firebase functionality:

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project named "pitchup-app"

2. **Enable Services**

   - Add email notifications

## 📱 **Mobile App Conversion:**

The Flutter codebase can easily be converted to mobile apps:

```bash
# For Android
flutter build apk --release

# For iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

## 🎨 **Customization Guide:**

### **Colors & Branding**
Update `lib/constants/app_constants.dart`:
```dart

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations:**

The app is already optimized with:
- **Image Caching**: Using `cached_network_image`
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient list rendering
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **Loading States**: Smooth user experience

## 📊 **Analytics & Monitoring:**

Add these for production:
- **Firebase Analytics**: Track user behavior
- **Crashlytics**: Monitor app crashes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track app performance
- **Google Analytics**: Detailed user insights

## 🔒 **Security Considerations:**

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Firebase Security Rules**: Configure proper Firestore rules
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **API Keys**: Never expose sensitive keys in client code

## 📈 **Scaling Considerations:**

- **CDN**: Use CloudFlare or AWS CloudFront for static assets
- **Database**: Consider Firestore scaling limits
- **Caching**: Implement Redis for frequently accessed data
